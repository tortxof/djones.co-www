## [rc-club-members](https://github.com/tortxof/rc-club-members)

This is a flask web app for managing members of an RC club. It was originally
using the CherryPy framework, but then switched to Flask. Both frameworks are
a joy to work with, but I think I'll be using mostly Flask from now on. The app
is written for Python 3, and uses sqlite3 for storage. It also takes advantage
of sqlite's full text search capabitily. Bootstrap is used for page style.
A Dockerfile is provided for easy deployment.
