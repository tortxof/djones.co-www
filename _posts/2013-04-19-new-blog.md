Why have a blog?
----------------

There are 2 main reasons I'm creating this blog. First, is just for my own benefit. There have been so many times that I've looked up the same information over and over, just because It's not fresh in my mind. Because I only code for myself as a hobby, I just don't get to do it often enough. The second reason is just to give back to the community. A lot of solutions to very specific coding problems have been found on personal blogs.

What am I going to write about?
-------------------------------

I'm definitely a novice programmer, so don't expect anything great coming from me. :) Nowadays I code in C for Arduino, Python, and I write BASH scripts to automate various things I do.

I'm learning Electronics Engineering. Focusing on analog stuff right now. Also, I've been experimenting with switch mode power supplies.

I fly RC planes and helicopters, so I'll definitely be writing about that. I soon will be getting into FPV and autonomous flight with [APM 2.5](http://diydrones.com/). I already have some aerial video on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/tortxof) and [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/tortxof).

I'll be writing about photography and video. I should actually be making some decent tutorials in this area.

And lastly, I'll be writing about whatever else I feel like writing about; So, who knows?
